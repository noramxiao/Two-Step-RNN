# Two-Step-RNN
> Python, TensorFlow, Sklearn

Fit participant data from the two-step task with an RNN to explain model-based/model-free decision-making. Work done with postdoc Jeff Cockburn and Prof. John O'Doherty at Caltech.

Can RNNs discern between model-based and model-free decision making in humans? We fit data (not provided here) from participants engaging in the standard two-step task. Using KFold cross-validation, we achieved upwards of 98% validation accuracy. Investigating the underlying dynamics of human decision-making has applications in psychiatry.
